In order to execute the programme, you will need to :

1\ Unzip submitted file (Machine learning)

2\ from moodle, download: dataset and testing_dataset: keep those names for the folder, it is important. When downloaded, place them in folder “Machine learning”

3\ from the following google drive address: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1coCGMhZcM3qZwmL_yzUKfDBuAwXqWP1P?usp=sharing
 download:
- Colored_decimal_pictures_binary_case
- File_name_binary_colored_pic
- Colored_decimal_pictures_for_hair
- File_name_hair_colored_pic

Note that if those file cannot be downloaded for some reasons, as explained in the code, it is still possible to generate them by setting ‘compute = True’ in section “Importing picture in color with hexadecimal code”. It will just take around 80-90 min to be generaded. So if possible, for convenience, get them from google drive link

4\ Unzip files: Colored_decimal_pictures_binary_case and Colored_decimal_pictures_for_hair

5\ Place the 4 (unzipped file) in folder “Machine learning”


6\ open the file ML_prog.ipynb using jupyter-notebook

7\ execute the code


Note that in the folder “Machine learning”, you will find 2 folders called CSV prediction and Pred_Unseen_data_test and each folder will contain 5 csv files

“CSV prediction contains” csv files asked in “Inference on the Test Set” section of the assignment. One file for each task. Those are the prediction made on the test part of the dataset (as it is spplited  into train and test)

“Pred_Unseen_data_test” contains csv files that are the predictions made by the models for unseen data given at the end.
