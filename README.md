# AMLSassignment
Assignment for Machine learning course

The file to take into account for the assigment are located in the folder: Final-ML_submission
In this folder the code, required files as well as read_me instructions are included.



Note, the other codes with extention .ipynb or .py are just here to prove that the code has been gradually built. 
They are poorly commented and contains some errors, as they are not the final version of my work.
